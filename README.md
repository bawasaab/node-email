# Configure Gmail account to accept less secure apps
Our application is classified as insecure by Gmail. To bypass it we can configure our account to allow insecure apps to connect with our account. When this configuration is enabled all apps with username and password can connect to our account in Gmail and send emails.
To enable it you need to go to https://myaccount.google.com/ and select your Google Account.
